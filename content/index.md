This project is plans for an operating system developed as a learning tool to explore the principles of OS design and implementation. The initial focus is on understanding the boot process, kernel development, and basic hardware interaction. It will start as a theoretical idea, move onto a toy project, and possibly evolve into a more advanced system in the future.

- ##### Goals:
	- Understand low-level system programming
	- Explore the x86 architecture and possibly x86_64.
	- Implement essential OS features such as keyboard input, display output and basic memory management.


You can see more detailed information in the [[Roadmap|roadmap]].

These notes are **heavily** based on the OSDev wiki, and the information on them will most definitely be more technical than my notes. My notes are mostly intended to write down things of importance for me to remember when designing certain elements of the OS.
